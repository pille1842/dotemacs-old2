# My Emacs configuration
This is my configuration for the [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) editor.

Most of the configuration takes place in [config.org](https://github.com/pille1842/dotemacs/blob/master/config.org). This file is loaded by [init.el](https://github.com/pille1842/dotemacs/blob/master/init.el) which also does some preliminary settings.

All of the configuration is licensed under the GNU GPLv3, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/pille1842/dotemacs/blob/master/LICENSE). Feel free to use any part or all of this configuration as you see fit.
